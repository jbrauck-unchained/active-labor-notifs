# active-labor-notifs
A python scripting project to send periodic notifications during your wife's active labor

This is an app that will utilize a few tools like requests, ntfy, and AP scheduler in order to send notifications to your iPhone.

Specifically this will be used during my wife's labor for the following reminders

## How to get started

This requires using ntfy - https://docs.ntfy.sh/
I have that installed on my homeserver via umbrel's app store.

Then get the ntfy app on your mobile device.

Subscribe to the notification top - Instructions for that right below

Clone this repo and then pip install requirements.txt

Run early_labor.py and let that shit ride.

## Reminder types - Early labor

### Hourly hydration reminder
In early labor, its important to remember to stay hydrated. Therefore once an hour we will ping that its time to take drink some water.

### Hourly pee reminder
In early labor, its also important to keep your bladder has not full as possible. Peeing frequently can give the uterus the space it needs to prepare for birth

### Semi-hourly stretch reminder
Keep things relaxed and stretched is great for the bodies' process of preparing for birth. Selects from a random array stretch types and tools used.
- Yoga ball
- Standing
- Sitting
- Knee/Pressure pushes

### Bi-hourly prayer time
Its important to remember to stave off any anxiety, stress, or adrenaline during early labor. Maintining a relaxed mindset is crucial, and who better to go to for that than the Lord. Prayer for my wife and baby. A gentle reminder that her body was purposed for this process.

### Random walk time - 3 times
Want to go for a walk? Idk decide if its the right time for it.
